## 👋 Hi, I’m Rafael

I love turning ideas into mobile experiences that feel natural and intuitive. With 10 years of programming experience and 2.6+ years focusing on Flutter, I build apps that people rely on every day. Working remotely at CV CRM, I’ve guided my team and helped launch over 28 apps that serve thousands of users worldwide.

## ✨ What Drives Me

When users open an app I built and it just works, that sense of delight inspires me. I aim to solve real problems with clean code and thoughtful design. I believe in listening closely to feedback, learning quickly, and sharing knowledge generously. Together we can create software that feels personal.

## 📈 Highlights of My Work

* Published over 28 apps on Play Store & App Store
* Significantly reduced critical bugs through comprehensive unit and integration testing
* Improved app launch times substantially by optimizing widget trees and lazy loading content
* Streamlined release process with Fastlane, enabling faster, more reliable deliveries
* Implemented modular architecture to accelerate new teammate onboarding and collaboration
